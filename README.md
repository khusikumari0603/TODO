a script for Personal Voice Assistant using Python. The query for the assistant can be manipulated as per the user‚Äôs need. The implemented assistant can open up the application (if it‚Äôs installed in the system), search Google, Wikipedia and YouTube about the query, calculate any mathematical question, etc by just giving the voice command. We can process the data as per the need or can add the functionality, depends upon how we code things. We are using Google speech recognition API and google text to speech for voice input and output respectively.


Here are some of the examples and output, which can help you understand how the above processing works.

1. Say "Search google Geeks for Geeks"
2. Say "Play Youtube your favourite song"
3. Say "Wikipedia Dhoni"
4. Say "Open Microsoft Word"
5. Say "Calculate anything you want"

   
In all the above cases, it will give do what is told. If the assistant can‚Äôt understand what is told it will ask you to google search it. For the thing which assistant can‚Äôt do is handled by this assistant. Below are some screenshots for the talk between human and the assistant.
